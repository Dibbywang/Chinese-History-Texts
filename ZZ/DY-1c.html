  <h1>DY-1 Analysis</h1>
  <h3>Written: 2024-9-27</h3>
  <p>
    I hope the text has given you a sufficient intuition as to what kind of text you are dealing with. Our analysis will start with the most emergent issues.<br><br>
    We see that there is a lot of dukes all over the place. Personally I regard all forms of feudalism fundamentally the same, and thus decided to import western titles onto these Chinese counterparts. It can be quite controversial, but it should be easy to ignore. To address my custom translations, as well as bring a bit of background, let's explore the social hiercy of the age. We are in the Eastern Zhou dynasty. With a ever mpre weakened central government, the feudal lords themselves with their armies became more and more independent, and thus they started declaring war among each other. The society by then relies on title that are inherited. All government officials are appointed not because of merit, but rather because they were once helpers of the original heros, or the helpers of the helpers, or more. A distinct four stage hiercy is present. The most powerful, the King, or the son of heaven, is the supreme leader and rules over everyone. The dukes are designated feudal lords who are given permission to rule over large amount of land. There is also rankings among the feudal lords, but this is a intricate subject that will become relevant in the future. Then came the high officials 大夫 and regular scholars 士. The rest are worthless farmers. To rise above the ranks, you need to do well in battle, which is why there is frequent war.<br><br>
    Viewed at a larger scale, most of the military and administrative power is centralized in the hands of not the king but rather than the dukes. Their territories became pseudo-kingdoms. Throughout the period some merged, some destroyed, and some split into multiples. The division of Chun Qiu and Zhan Guo (warring states period) is based on when Confucius finished Chun Qiu, but it is also reflected in the scale of conflicts between the countries. In Chun Qiu, the conflicts are less direct and people still obeyed the nominal authority of Zhou. In the warring states period, people no longer obeyed the societal order even nominally. Instead people declare war at will, and at the later parts even the Zhou became a target of attacks as a result of the rising ambitions of Qin, the future Qin dynasty. Confucius is from the country of Lu, which is why everything in this text is written from this perspective.<br><br>
    There is not much to talk about regarding the content of this text, for I believe it is written rather clear. What is worth remarking however, is the meaning of certain terms. The yellow spring refers to the Chinese afterlife, but it can also just mean the water you find deep underground. DUring the reconciliation ceremony, the duke abused this definition to reconciliate with his mother even though he made a curse that required him to see his mother only after death.

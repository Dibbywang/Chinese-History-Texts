    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Writing introductions is a very difficult task. One must encapsulate most of the information as well as one's own experience when reading into a few paragraphs that grabs the attention of the readers. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that this one might not even have read the text in full. I wish that I can be more qualified for this translation job, but I feel like in postponing this work I am stripping the world of some should be very valuable resources. I will try to keep this introduction close to what I know: the generals about the text; the feelings I have about it, perhaps why Zuo Zhuan and why start with it; as well as good points to pay attention to throughout the reading. For my readers, you are fully empowered to treat me as some random internet dumbass trying to do something about history, but I would greatly appreciate your attention.<br><br>
        Zuo Zhuan, or in its full name Zuo Shi Chun Qiu, is a sort of test taking helper for the Chun Qiu, or more commonly known as the Annals of Spring and Autumn written by the great Confucius. Confucius is regarded as a great educator, and this title is not without a reason. He wrote and revised many textbooks that became regarded as the classics and kept being in use until modern times. This Chun Qiu nowadays is a great historical text, but at the time it served as a textbook for a probably rather unexpected field--politics. He probably taught this book in schools by explaining recent or past events so that the students may be able to learn the workings of the no-less chaotic political scene that is the era of Spring and Autumn. We commonly associate Confucius with fidelity, with familial virtues, with great but strange thoughts that you need to find application by thinking about it. However, Chun Qiu reveals the side of Confucius that you may not be aware of. To survive in that world, get paid with real meat, and to fill your stomach so much to the point where you cease to care about sustenance and instead can think about how should families function and what is the greater good, you need real talent. He exposed the workings of power and laid them bare on the ground for one to learn. From these texts, you see how their system functions, and you find who betrays you in which way. One problem with this Chun Qiu is that clearly Confucius and his direct students taught it, because it omitted an absurd amount of detail that it should be called a crime. Fortunately, for whatever reason, someone (real author is subject to quite a lot of debate) decided to pick up Chun Qiu and add the necessary details to it. The result is this Zuo Zhuan. This 200 thousand character book expands upon Chun Qiu by putting more context to all the events. Of course one should not take the events literally, because as always these events are conveyed through dialogue and scenes rather than solid (in my opinion less interesting) who-did-whats. Given time, one should be able to find something useful from this text, and I will try and write the analysis that elaborates a bit more on the context given. The structure is also quite different. Although events are listed by year, they are listed through the lives and deaths of dukes. You may easily convert them to the Gregorian Calendar by searching for the birth dates of the dukes.<br><br>
        A bit about my experience with the text. It is hilarious that even though Zuo Zhuan is almost the first traditional Chinese historical text I read, yet I never gotten around to finishing it because I found it to be terrifying for its sheer volume. The text is not very approachable. Chun Qiu is weird and confusing, and due to the age of the text, place names and some words are lost because of time. However, this does not mean that it is not valuable. There is a systematic neglect of classics from where I learned my history. It is almost as if knowing the text they based their ideas from exposes how ridiculous their claims are. And due to the ongoing global decoupling there will be fewer and fewer translators that will be willing to transfer these valuable texts from one language to another. I love Chinese history, and I love my country's culture. It is a great shame that we purposefully shut ourselves in because of control freaks. I want to make it all available, for free, for everyone in the English speaking scene, because I believe there is something to be learned. Zuo Zhuan is obscure, it is difficult, it is not very well known, and also came from a period that is covered in the mist for most English speaker. But it is also how everything started. As a children, I read comics depicting the age. As an adult, I take pride in what I know and share it with everyone.<br><br>
        "Remember, the start is always difficult." I am told this to kickstart me on this translation journey, and I am telling you this too when reading. This is a heavy and cumbersome text, but find joy in every little improvement. Enjoy the stories, try to understand why did the writer said this, and never trust anyone, even me! Think for yourself, because basing your reasoning directly on the source empowers you to disagree with others. I will keep updating perhaps once a week. We will see how this project turns out. As always, thank you for your support. I wish you a very pleasant journey. <br><br>
        Sincerely,<br>Ding Muyan.

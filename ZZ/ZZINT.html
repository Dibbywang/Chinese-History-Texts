    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Writing Introduction for a text is difficult. More so when the text is not written by you, and even more so when you haven't even read the whole text yet. However this happens everywhere. Chinese history texts are rich. They are excellent pieces of work recording what happens at a time where technology has barely developed. Preserved by generations of scholars and a largely continuous culture, these texts gave modern Chinese historians a rich platform to form theories of the past. However, due to the vast amount of past work, frequently the study of the classics is ignored. In fact, most Chinese people nowadays have never read  even one of the ancient classic historical texts, yet the introduction, contents and general idea is given on textbooks by people who also heard it from others. It is rather sad, and especially so when these classics themselves are rich with material and ideas. By even engaging with one good section gives you a good idea of how ancient Chinese society works. <br>
        Zuo Zhuan, or in its full name Zuo Shi Chun Qiu, is like a barron AP helper for a textbook called Chun Qiu, or more commonly known as the Spring and Autumn Annals, which is believed to be composed by the great Confucius. It is a textbook in the area that you might not expect--politics--rather than history, because what is taught is the contemporary events in the eyes of its students. Confucius in his lessons likely analyzed the various events and told the students, future dukes and officials, what they should do in each situation. These lessons are not the lessons about how to be a good person or how to respect that you commonly expect from Confucius. No, rather they are solid how-tos telling you how to survive and prosper in a no less diverse and complex political climate that is the era of the East Zhou Dynasty. Zuo Zhuan is one of the three helper books for this Chun Qiu, but it is regarded as the best, because while the other two focused on test taking, this one gave the contexts that is missing from Chun Qiu but still took its time in making you think about the events. It doesn't force upon you what is right or wrong, but rather let's you think how you should act in that situation, or why did these characters did this, said this, when you clearly shouldn't. It is not your conventional historical text, in the way that it narrates the events through dialogues and action, but the real purpose of these characters is hidden for you to decipher. <br>
        Zuo Zhuan is structured as a section written by Confucius and then the analysis, or rather the expansion. Some are clearly not very meaningful, and is meant only as a extension in terms of detail, but there is frequently actually interesting stories, which is what you should pay attention to. Now beware, because of the sheer age of the text (circa. 700 yo 400 B.C.), there are things that are lost to time, like place names and some details, I hope that you can overcome these obstacles and extract the useful information from it. <br>
        I decided to start with this book because it is one of the reasons why I started history. It is also what I believe most should start with. To learn Chinese history, you must start with the pinnacle, the begining, how everything started, so as to know what people in the future based their reasonings from. So please do well with what I have given you here. You are now unclocking youself an opportunity in Chinese history that not even many Chinese people have.<br>
        I hope you enjoy this text. I will continuously update everything if I have time and I will try writing analysises to explain what is happening.

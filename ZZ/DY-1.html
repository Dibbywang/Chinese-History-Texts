    The original wife of the Duke Hui is Meng Zi. Meng Zi died, and the duke remarried with Sheng Zi. Sheng Zi gave birth to the Duke Yin. The Duke Wu of Song gave birth to Zhong Zi. When she was born, there is text on her hand that said "become the wife of Lu, " which is why she is then mdearried to the duke of our country. She then gave birth to Duke Huan. Duke Hui then died. The Duke Yin succeeded the Duke Hui as his son.

    Duke Yin year one, Confucius did not write anything about the ceremony of Duke of Yin succeeding his father even though it typically happens around this time, this is because he is ruling as a reagent.<br>
    March, the alliance between duke Yin and Yi fu of Zhu. Yi fu is the Duke of Zhu, but this position did not came about on the appointment of the King. As a sign of protest, Confucius did not write the title. The choice of calling him Yi Fu instead of his name is a sign of respect. Duke Yin got his title from being a reagent, so he is in a hurry of conducting alliances with other countries to solidify his title. Therefore they conducted the alliance at Mie.

    By the time Duke Zhuang ascended the throne as the new Duke of Zheng, Wu Jiang asked the land of Zhi for Gong Shu Duan. The new Duke of Zheng replied "Zhi is a dangerous place, the old leader of East Guo who used to rule there was deposed because he relied on the difficult terrain for defense and neglected the needs of the people. " They then asked for the land of Jing, which the duke allowed. People then started calling him the ‚ÄùBig Uncle in Jing Castle."
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="p5" class="te">
    Ji Zhong said "His capital is over 100 Zhi, which made it a problem for our country. In the past, the old dukes decided that big cities shall not exceed one third of the capital, middle shall not exceed one fifth, and small ones no more than one ninth. Now this city of Jing has been expanded beyond limits, which violated our rules. This cannot be good for you my lord." The duke said:"it is demanded by my mother, how can I avoid this trouble?" Ji Zhong replied;"The wrong committed by this woman called Jiang is more than enough. It is better to just put her in her place. Don't let it spread. If this evil spreads, it shall be difficult to contain. Even weed is hard to remove, so is your mother's favorite child." The duke replied:"Those who repeatedly do wrong will eventually bring about their own destruction. We merely need to wait for it to happen."
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="p6" class="te">
    Soon after, the "Big Uncle" asked the north and west parts of the realm of Zheng to betray the realm and join him. Gong Zi Lv said "the realm cannot have two leaders, now what do you plan to do? If you plan to leave your brother your realm, then I ask you to allow me to serve him. If you do not allow me, then please destroy him and avoid confusing the people." Duke Zhuang replied "There will be no need to destroy him, for he will meet his demise." Then the "Big Uncle" expanded his territory again, making it very far and all the way until Liao Yan. Gong Zi Lv said:"Now would be a great time to act. He now has a formidable territory. It would not be long for him to gain the support of the people." Duke Zhuang said "His disloyalty to me as his leader and his betrayal to me as his brother meant that despite his land, he will still face his demise."
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="p7" class="te">
    The "Big Uncle" gathered people, built armor, arranged vehicles and prepared to strike the capital by surprise. Wu Jiang is informed of the plan and decided to help by opening the city gates during the day of the attack. The duke heard about the plans and said that it shall be the time to act. He ordered Zi Feng to lead 200 charriots to attack Jing. The city of Jing decided to betray Duan and return to the rule of the duke. Duan, with his plans falling apart, escaped to Yin, which the duke then ordered an attack on. In May, Duan escaped to the place of Gong. Confucius wrote "Summer, May, Zheng Bo defeated Duan at the place called Yian. " Because Duan did not act like the duke's brother, he didn't write Duan as his brother. Their battle is almost as if they are two leaders, which is why he used the word defeat. Calling the duke Zheng Bo, which meant the senior member of the family which rules the realm of Zheng, is mocking his failure at disciplining his family. Calling the expell of Duan from the lands of Zheng an escape is criticizing the duke's decision of attempting to kill his brother. <br>
    As for the duke's mother, the duke decided to place her at the city of Yin. For her wrongdoings, he told his mother "I will see you in the yellow spring." But then he immediately regrets it.

  <div id="p8" class="te">
    Yin Kao Shu is the person assigned to manage the land of Yin. Hearing the story, he decided to offer gifts to the duke. The duke gave him food for his gifts. During the feast, Yin Kao Shu left some meat to the side, and the duke asked why. He replied:"My mom at home always ate the food I cooked, but she has never tried your food. Please allow me to give it to her." The duke said:"your mother is still here, but mine I cannot ever see again." Yin Kao Shu said:"May I ask you why is that?" The duke replied with the events that happened before, and also told Yin Kao Shu his regrets. To which he responded:"Why should you worry? If you dig down until you found a spring, meet each other in the tunnel, who said that this is not allowed?" The duke then followed the plan. The Duke entered the tunnel and recited: "Within the great tunnel, the joy is harmonious and warm."  Lady Jiang exited the tunnel and recited: "Outside the great tunnel, the joy flows gently and freely."  Thus, mother and son were reconciled as before.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="p9" class="te">
    The noble man said: "Ying Kao-shu is truly filial. He loves his mother and extends this kindness to Duke Zhuang. The Book of Poetry says: 'A filial son never falters, and his virtues will forever benefit his kind.' Is this not what it refers to?"

  <div id="p10" class="te">
    Autumn, July, the King of Zhou sent Zai Xuan to give the deceased Duke Hui and his wife Zhong Zi ceremonial items for his passing. This event was delayed.  At that time Zhong Zi is still alive, which is why Confucius mentioned her name. The death of a king requires seven months of waiting before the funeral, and all other kings must be present; the death of a duke require five months of waiting, and all dukes which are allied to him must participate in the funeral; the death of a high official, three months is required, and all that are at the same rank should be present. For scholars, a month of waiting is required, and relatives by marriage will attend. The gifts must not be given to the dead body, and visits to the living must not commence before they have started grieving. To prepare for a funeral before the passing of a person is against the rites.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="p11" class="te">
    August, the country of Qi invaded the country of Yi, but Yi did not report it, so Confucius did not write it. There is cockroaches, but it did not become a disaster, so it is also not written. In Duke Hui's later years, he defeated the army of Song at Huang. After this victory, he sought peace. In the September, he made an alliance with the people of Song at Su, and thus relations were restored.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div id="p10" class="te">
    Winter, October, The Duke of Wei came to participate in the funeral, but he did not meet the Duke Yin. Therefore this event is not recorded. When the rebelion of Gong Shu occured, Gong Sun Hua escaped to the country of Wei, Wei waged war against Zheng on his behalf and took the place called Lin Yan.  The army of Zheng along with royal troops and the army of Guo attacked the southern border of Wei. Wei requested reinforcements from Zhu, The ruler of Zhu secretly sent people to discuss with the Duke's son Yu. Yu asked the duke to allow him to go, which the duke did not allow, but he decided to disregard this order. They conducted an alliance with the people of Zhu and Zheng at the place of Yi. Because it is not the order of our duke, It is not recorded.

  <div id="p11" class="te">
    A new south gate is constructed. Because it is not the duke's order, it is not recorded.<br>
    December, Ji Bo came. Because this is not the order of the duke, it is not recorded.<br> 
    Zhong Fu died, because the duke did not participate in the event, the exact date is not recorded.
